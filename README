🧠 Autism Detection Using Machine Learning
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on behavioral and demographic data. With increasing awareness around early intervention, this tool aims to support faster, scalable, and accessible screening solutions.

📌 Overview
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects communication and behavior and is often underdiagnosed, especially in young children and underserved communities. Using a labeled dataset and multiple classification algorithms, this project classifies individuals as likely autistic or not based on answers to screening questions and basic demographic inputs.

🧬 Dataset
The dataset contains:

Responses to A1–A10 screening questions

Demographic attributes like age, gender, ethnicity, and relation

Class labels (autistic/not)

Additional fields such as sum_score and a derived binary indicator (ind)

The dataset has been cleaned, encoded, and balanced to ensure fair model performance across different subgroups.

🔧 Features & Techniques
Preprocessing: Label encoding, null handling, and feature derivation (sum_score)

Class Balancing: Handled data imbalance using oversampling

Models Used:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

XGBoost Classifier

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

🚀 Real-World Applications
✅ Mobile Screening Apps — Integrated ASD screening in early childhood apps
✅ Clinics and Schools — Tools for counselors or teachers to flag at-risk students
✅ HealthTech Startups — As a backend ML service for diagnostic platforms
✅ Public Health Research — Useful for epidemiological studies across regions

By digitizing early screening and reducing manual diagnosis dependency, this model supports faster intervention — critical for better developmental outcomes. 💡

📈 Results
All models showed reliable performance with balanced datasets. XGBoost gave the highest accuracy and recall. Visualizations (confusion matrix, bar plots) are included in the notebook.
